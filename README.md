🧠 Intent-Based Chatbot using Python & NLP
📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered intent-based chatbot that can understand user inputs and respond accordingly using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The chatbot classifies user intents and replies with predefined responses. It’s also integrated with a Streamlit web interface for user interaction.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the process of intent recognition using NLP.

Build and train a classification model to predict user intents.

Design an interactive chat UI using Streamlit.

Deploy a simple, conversational AI prototype.

🧩 Technologies Used

Python

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, Streamlit, json

Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes (intent classification)

Dataset: intents.json (custom dataset with tags, patterns, and responses)

⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing

Loaded the intents dataset from a JSON file.

Cleaned and tokenized text data using NLTK.

Transformed text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked dataset distribution and class balance.

Visualized intent frequencies using Matplotlib/Seaborn (optional).

3. Model Building

Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%).

Trained a Logistic Regression model for intent classification.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification report.

4. Chatbot Integration

Implemented a chatbot function that matches user input → predicts intent → returns predefined response.

Integrated the model with Streamlit UI for a clean and interactive experience.

5. Testing

Tested chatbot with multiple queries to verify correct intent classification and response generation.

💡 Learnings & Outcomes

Gained hands-on experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts.

Learned text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, vectorization, lemmatization).

Understood the complete ML pipeline — from data cleaning to deployment.

Learned how to integrate ML models into web applications using Streamlit.

👨‍🏫 Mentor Experience

My mentor provided valuable technical guidance and helped me understand practical NLP implementation. Their feedback during model tuning and deployment improved the chatbot’s accuracy and UI.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Integrate speech-to-text and text-to-speech features.

Connect the chatbot with APIs (e.g., weather, news).

Add contextual memory for better multi-turn conversations.
